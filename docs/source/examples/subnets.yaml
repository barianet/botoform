# This is an example of a 4 subnet schema.
# Each subnet has a size of 27 which is a /27 CIDR (32 addresses).
# Two are attached to the private route_table, and two to the public.
# We round robin AZ letters if availability_zone is not defined.
# Instances will launch into subnet with public IPs, if public is True.
